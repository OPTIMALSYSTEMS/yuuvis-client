# @yuuvis/framework

Component library for creating applications facing a yuuvis backend.

## Intentions

This library provides yuuvis developers with a collection of UI components for creating their own client applications.
It depends on `@yuuvis/core` and `@yuuvis/common-ui` and is also the foundation of the yuuvis client application.
